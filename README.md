# Full Stack Engineer Challenge Paypay Baymax

## Assumptions
At the beginning when I was analyzing the project, I noticed the first CRUD Employee module and Performance Reviews with foreign keys, but I saw there was two differente views, so I assumed that the project needed a security system, managing different users and permissions inside the platform. 

## Technology and design choices

### Frontend
I used Vuejs as the main frontend framework, using Javascript as the main programming language, also I used others to help in the UI such as Vuetify (Material design).

### Backend
I used Spring Boot/Hibernate as the main backend framework, using Java as the main programming language for making the server side APIs and make the connection with the frontend, creating the core and middleware restful APIs, builded with Open api 3.0.

### Database
I used SQL Server on this project, because it fits more with all the sub modules of Spring such as hibernate and security and improves the performance on the transactionality.


## Identify areas of your strengths
I had previous projects with similar requirements working as Fullstack web developer, also I worked with the three main frontend frameworks (Angular, Vue, React), so I felt really comfortable coding on the frontend, but also I worked on the backend on previous companies, only with Spring Boot (Java).
